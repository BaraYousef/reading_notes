# Growth Mindset  

**we** have to be *positive* inspite of all the circumstances , we have to take things easily , we should divide any ***problem*** or any trouble into small pieces and solve it piece by piece
also we need to face our destiny through improving our skills by learning new things reading , watching videos , no one is perfect , I like waht einstein has said no one is stupid 
but cant ask a fish to climb a tree , the fear of failure stops us form trying to reach our goals the couarge isnt the fear's abscence its how to face the fear it self and your  fears , I find reading and practical skills in your life give the wisdom and its like a torch fights the darkness every where , thomas edison when he was young he used to read alot of books although he failed in his school he then became 
>> a great inventor 


> I'm developing and improving my self through reading about successful people and thier diaries and watching motivational videos learning from persons older than me
